--- CSS basics ---

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

--- What is CSS? ---

Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

p {
	color: red;
}

--- Anatomy of a CSS ruleset ---

The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:

Selector
This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.

Declaration
This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.

Properties
These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.

Property value
To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)

Note the other important parts of the syntax:

Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.

Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.

To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:

p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

--- Selecting Multiple Elements ---

You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:

p,
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}

--- Different types of selectors ---

There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selector, which select all elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more common types of selectors:

A. - Selector Name

1A. - Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)

B. - What does it select

1B. - All HTML elements of the specified type.

C. - Example

1C. - p selects <p>

--

2A. - ID selector

2B. - The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML page, each id value should be unique

2C. - #my-id selects <p id="my-id"> or <a id="my-id">

--

3A. - Class Selector

3B. - The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple instances of the same class can appear on a page

3C. - .my-class selects <p class="my-class"> and <a class="my-class">

--

4A. - Attribute Selector

4B. - The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute

4C. - img[src] selects <img src="myimage.png"> but not <img>

--

5A. - Pseudo-class selector

5B. - The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursos hovers over a link).

5C. - a:hover selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.

--- NOTE ---

Anything in CSS between /* and */ is a CSS comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code. CSS comments are a way for you to write helpful notes about your code or logic.
